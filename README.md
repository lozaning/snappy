Unless you know exactly why you'd use this one, you want the actual trustwave version
This version has been specially modified to ignore MAC addresses, because thats what my very niche usecase dictates

snap.py v1.0 - trustwave spiderlabs
 
(Snap)shot SHA256 hashes of wireless access points to determine whether something has changed since your last visit (e.g. rogue AP), plus detect airbase-ng in use.
 
Feed it .pcap/.cap file for offline mode or change 'sniff' to an interface to run live. e.g. ./snap.py goodness.cap
